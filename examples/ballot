HOW TO VOTE

Do not erase anything between the lines below and do not change the
choice names.

In the brackets next to your preferred choice, place a 1. Place a 2 in
the brackets next to your next choice. Continue till you reach your
last choice. Do not enter a number smaller than 1 or larger than 8.
You may skip numbers.  You may rank options equally (as long as all
choices X you make fall in the range 1<= X <= 8).

To vote "no, no matter what" rank "Further Discussion" as more
desirable than the unacceptable choices, or You may rank the "Further
Discussion" choice, and leave choices you consider unacceptable
blank. Unranked choices are considered equally the least desired
choices, and ranked below all ranked choices. (Note: if the Further
Discussion choice is unranked, then it is equal to all other unranked
choices, if any -- no special consideration is given to the Further
Discussion choice by the voting software).

Then mail the ballot to: rainbow@someplace.org. 
Don't worry about spacing of the columns or any quote characters
(">") that your reply inserts. NOTE: The vote must be GPG signed
(or PGP signed) with your key that is in the Debian keyring.
