=head1 NAME

dvt-publish - Given the results, voter logs, and tally sheet, send a signed message

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dvt-publish -c /path/to/config 

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine is designed to allow publication of the results by
putting together a signed email message and sending it off to the
configured address.

It reads the tally sheet produced by dvt-tally, and the output file
produced by dvr-rslt, and creates a MIME message that has the results
text, the tally sheet, and, if it is a secret ballot, the list of
voters. It then signs the email, and send it to the list of configured
targets.

=cut

=head2 Internal Implementation

=head3 publish

This is the workhorse routine. 
This routine pays attention to the configuration variables
Quorum_File, Tally_File, Max_Choices, and Results.
