dvt-ldap \-c /path/to/config
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This routine is designed to query the debian ldap server to determine
the unique uid for every debian developer.  This is the fifth phase in
ballot processing.
.PP
The unique uid that is determined from \s-1LDAP,\s0 using the key fingerprint
as a filter, shall be used as primary index, allowing for developers
with multiple keys to still be able to replace their vote. The \s-1LDAP\s0
check also acts as an additional check; there are keys in the keyring
that belong to administrative roles in Debian (Security Key, for
instance), which should not have voting privileges.
.PP
It is important to add a filter to limit the matches from \s-1LDAP,\s0 if,
like Debians \s-1LDAP,\s0 the server contains entries for people other than
those enfranchised.
.PP
Additionally, this script attempts to be idempotent. It is also
incremental, unless a force option is given, in which case it
re-queries the \s-1LDAP DB.\s0
.SS "Internal Implementation"
.IX Subsection "Internal Implementation"
This routine pays attention to configuration parameters LDAP_Dir,
Nack_Dir, Ldap_Host, Ldap_Base, Check_Dir, Msg_Suffix, Msg_Preffix,
and Force.

Specify an alternate configuration file to read in for this run. Note:
this script does not do any sophisticated option parsing or checking.

Redo the copy even if the destination file already exists.
