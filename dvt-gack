=head1 NAME

dvt-gack - generate an acknowledgement for the vote

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dvt-gack -c /path/to/config

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is responsible for generating the acknowledgement for the
vote, after ensuring that the ballot passed GPG and LDAP checks. If
vote is by secret ballot, it creates a secret key associated with
the voter (since the voter is identified by the uid field of the LDAP
data, each voter can be uniquely identified); we only have one key per
voter, no matter how many times the voter votes. This key, along
with the name of the voter, is passed on to hmac function and the
resulting string is displayed on the final tally sheet.

The ack also notes if this is not the first vote by the voter,

=cut

=head2 Internal Implementation

This utility pays attention to the configuration options Work_Dir,
Log_Dir, Tally_Dir, Ack_Dir, Temp_Dir, LDAP_Dir, Msg_Suffix,
Msg_Preffix, Force, and Alias_DB.
