=head1 NAME

dvt-rslt - Given a tally sheet, calculate the Condorcet winner

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dvt-rslt -c /path/to/config 

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Produce the results, taking into consideration the tally, quorum
requirements, and the per option majority requirements, if any.
This routine is the heart of the voting system. It takes into account
quorum requirements (reading the output file produced by dvt-quorum),
and also the configured majority requirements, if any.

It reads the tally sheet produced by dvt-tally, and creates the
initial beat matrix; and the pairwise defeat list, and finally the
schwartz set. If there are defeats between the members of the schwartz
set, it drops the weakest defeat and repeats, until there is a winner.

It puts the results in the configured output file.

=cut

=head2 Internal Implementation

=head3 winner

This is the workhorse routine. 
This routine pays attention to the configuration variables
Quorum_File, Tally_File, Max_Choices, and Results.
